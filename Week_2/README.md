# Week 2 – Love, Predators, and Dynamic Systems
## Matrix Diagonalisation
See [refresher notes](./diagonalisation_notes.md).
## Exercises
### Romeo and Juliet
* Implement the Romeo and Juliet system yourself in Mathematica
* Explore the parameter space of the matrix – Can you identify different regimes of the system. What do they correspond to in terms of the problem domain?
* Can you construct a parameter space diagram.
* Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix, draw them at the origin of the phase space diagram, how does this correspond to the dynamics?
### Predator Prey
* Explore different variations of the predator-prey model.
* For each system, find the fixed points, and linearise about them - what are their characteristics.
* How much can be solved analytically – can you determine the regions in parameter space?
* Build a Mathematica toy for a Preditor-Prey model.
