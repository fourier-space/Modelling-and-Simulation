This module will give a view of how numeric simulations can be applied to problems in Design Engineering (and some problems selected from physical, biological, and social sciences). An underpinning of numerical methods, algorithms, and analysis tools will complement applications to a range of systems, such as infection modelling and crowd dynamics. We will explore how results can be interpreted, visualised, and how much we should trust them with tools to analyse these questions. The module will range from numeric underpinning to chaos and game theory with a range of applications that will give an early career researcher a window into the range of tools available to them.

## Learning outcomes
*On completion of this module, you will be better able to:*
* Apply a range of numerical and computational methods.
* Construct numerical and mathematical models that capture the key features of a design engineering problem.
* Analyse algorithms for stability, accuracy, and computational complexity.
* Interpret simulation results and their implications in their wider design engineering context.
* Represent simulation results and data graphically for understanding, exploration, and communication.
