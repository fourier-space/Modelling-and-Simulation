# Assessment

For the Modelling and simulation coursework, you will pick a dynamic system to study that represents an in-context problem and report on your analysis of that system in a report of up to 2200 words with accompanying code notebook in a GitHub repository.

**Deadline: 09/12/2024 16:00**
Submission on Blackboard.

The assessment criteria of the assignment are derived from the module's learning outcomes:

- **Construct numerical and mathematical models that capture the key features of a design engineering problem.**
	- Define the scope of the system you are studying in terms of its own context.
	- Identify the variables, parameter, and assumptions of the system.
	- Iteratively increase the complexity of the system, starting with the smallest meaningful model, and increasing in complexity to capture new features, behaviours, or interventions.
- **Apply a range of numerical and computational methods.**
	- Implement your system model numerically for analysis and prediction.
	- Evaluate characteristic units of the system, e.g. characteristic time, for scaling / non-dimensionalisation.
- **Analyse algorithms for stability, accuracy, and computational complexity.**
	- Analyse the characteristics of the system in terms of fixed points, regions of phase space, and chaos.
	- Identify any bifurcations in the system and the system parameters that drive them.
	- Investigate the sensitivity to parameters and initial conditions with ensemble simulations.
- **Interpret simulation results and their implications in their wider design engineering context.**
	- Explain numerical results and how they describe the system being modelled.
	- Justify interventions in the context by making predictions of how your interventions will affect the state of your system.
- **Represent simulation results and data graphically for understanding, exploration, and communication.**
	- E.g. with systems diagrams, time evolution, phase space diagrams, bifurcation diagrams.
	- Use of animation or interactive plots for communication.
	- Present Wolfram notebook code in an clear and structured manner (link to repository).
	- Proper referencing of sources.

## Theme – *Zombies!*
The theme for this run of the module is modelling a zombie apocalypse.
The book [Mathematical modelling of zombies (Online access from Library)](https://library-search.imperial.ac.uk/permalink/44IMP_INST/mek6kh/alma991000664633901591), is a collection of pedagogic papers investigating the zombie apocalypse as a dynamical system, usually with analogies to epidemiological modelling for real-world diseases. The starting point being a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model, which has also been the starting point to model the COVID pandemic. Have a read of these, you are to make a report in the same style.

You can take your model in numerous directions as you wish, some suggestions being,
* Different strains of zombies and how that affects their deadliness.
* Spatial dependence of infection – can we run and hide?
* Seasonal variation – Winter is coming!
* Defensive strategies and interventions.
* Long term zombie strategy.

If zombies aren't your thing, you're welcome to choose a different theme, so long as you are able to meet the assessment criteria above. Discuss with me if you want to check you're heading in the right direction.
