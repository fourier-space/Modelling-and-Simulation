# Chaos, Fractals
## Lorenz Attractor
* Look up and investigate the Hopf Bifurcation, where as the 2D+ analogy of a pitchfork bifurcation in a radial dimension, limit cycles spontaneously appear.
* Investigate the bifurcations of the Lorenz system with a changing $r$ parameter ($Ïƒ = 10, b = 8 / 3$).
* For the specific $r = 28$ case, investigate the chaotic behaviour of this system, i.e sensitivity to initial conditions, growth of uncertainty and volume.

## Logistic Growth with discrete timesteps
* Re-derive how the continuous logistic growth maps to the Logistic Map that is a similar looking discrete system when using the Euler Forward method.
* See that the logistic map is, under a coordinate transformation, the same as the quadratic map of the Mandelbrot Set.
* Research Hausdorff dimension. Look into this for
    * The boundary of the Mandelbrot Set
    * The Feigenbaum Attractor
    * The Lorenz Attractor
