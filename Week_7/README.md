# Newton's Method
* Apply Newton's method to a range of functions and find the basin of attraction for each of their roots.
* Do different functions give interesting fractals?

## Colisions
* Use this method to model a pool table with two balls.

## Poincaré Maps
* Research Poincaré Maps. Can they be applied to other systems we've seen?
