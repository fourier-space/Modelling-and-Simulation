# Week 4 – Lagrangian Mechanics, Double Pendulum, Runge Kutta Falkberg Method

* Look up and derive for the double pendulum system (Massless rods, massive ends)
    * The Euler-Lagrange equations.
    * From here derive the equations of motion.
* Find all stationary points of this system,
    * What states do these correspond to?
    * What is the total energy, E, of each of these states?
    * Linearise about each point, what is their character?
    * For the orbit solution, what is the frequency of oscillation? What is the eigenvector of these modes. How does this correspond to translation and vibration?
* Experiment with nearby initial conditions, how quickly do they diverge
* Can you find chaotic solutions? Can you find non-chaotic areas of parameter space?
* Read about Poincaré Map for the double pendulum.
* Can you reproduce this tweet? https://x.com/j_bertolotti/status/1411987574109913092
   * There's a higher resolution and Mathematica code for it on wikimedia commons: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Double_pendulum_predicting_dynamics.gif ,
   * See if you can work out what the code is doing. Bit of a warning - it takes a long time to fully run. Edit the table function to make it shorter `Table[…, {t, 0, 1, 0.3}]`.
